jzeferino.XSAddin is personal project that creates a Xamarin Studio add-in to let you create a Xamarin Cross Platform solution (Xamarin.Native) or (Xamarin.Forms).
When creating the project the add-in will show you a custom wizard wich the user can select the application name, the application identifier and if he wants .gitignore, readme and cake.
It also creates some PCL (ViewModel, Service, Controller, Localisation and Tests) projects to allow the shared code to be separated in different layers using a MVVM pattern.
It also allows you to create some file templates.
